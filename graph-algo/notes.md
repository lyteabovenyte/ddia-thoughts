#### chapter 1. introduction

- A graph is a representation of a network,
- A **data model** organizes a set of data and establishes how different data elements relate to one another. Data models help organizations use their data effectively for decision making and other business needs. A relational model organizes data in terms of *tables*. A graph data model, on the other hand, views data as a graph, taking into account the *relationships* within the dataset. Graph data modeling is the process of describing a dataset to be able to use it in a graph database such as Neo4j, Azure Cosmos DB, or others. This process means deciding which elements within your dataset will be defined as nodes, edges, and properties. There is no one set way to do this, so graph data modeling involves some important decision making to ensure the graph is useful to its end users. 
- modeling graphs is only half the story. We might also want to *process* them to
reveal insight that isnâ€™t immediately obvious. This is the domain of graph algorithms.
